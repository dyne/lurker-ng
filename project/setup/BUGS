Make self-dependency:
	Adding an old depend to an objects dependencies still means the
	target must be rebuilt, but make will not do this.

Move:
	Under unix, doing a 'mv -f some-file.c some-dep-file.c' can
	overwrite the target file thus requiring a rebuild. However, it
	won't happen if some-file.c is older than the target

.*.d:	renaming a file can lead to "cannot rebuild depfile" errors
