Ideas:
	errordocument failthrough configable

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Date goto in mindex

	lurkerctrl
		show status of lurker
		stop/start request processing
		dump cache files

	Better packing of tree

	If we get an HTML only email, we don't do anything smart - just
	escape all the tags. This is ok, but it would be nice if we stripped
	them and discarded contents of <head><style>... for instance.

BUGS:
	Really use common code for keywords -- ("j.t." breaks)
	Honour indenting in email
	We don't check for double append
	Presently we have no keyword write buffer
	
	Attachments are never cached because we need to tell the browser
	the content-type and we have no way to record this.
