What about the same message in multiple lists?
Ideally want to reuse id and only have one indexed copy - both lists
	refer to the message.

Also, we need to know the offset of a given message in each list.
	Unfortunately, the message may occur in multiple lists.
	FAWK! Should list them all.
	There will still be a 'primary' list from which we retrieve the
	message.

For threading:
	subject merging only - DOES span lists
	has dangling zigzag for topic drift (seperate row with diff subj shown)
	IN FACT! Don't do threading AT ALL! ... well need sim. subject linkage
	Since I want dangling arrows, I'm already going to have to hit
	disk for every single message -> seek

Would also be cool to have a 'jump to first occurance in a given list' for
the thread.
