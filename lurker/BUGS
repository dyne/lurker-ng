Ideas:
	secured lists? login required?
	Allow control of ascending/descending sort

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Boolean "or" in search
	Better packing of tree
	German pot

BUGS:
	Need a better way to clean cache.
	Timezones suck. Need to localize times to the browser.
	
	-> control chars in utf-8 xml seem to break as invalid charset?
	   odd since they are low bit ascii and thus valid utf-8
	-> folded header lines from email break apache
	   stream the header without \r\n, replace with spaces
