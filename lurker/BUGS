---- Agenda for 1.2:

Maildir support for import
Set timestamp to config file + all used messages
off-site mailing list links?
delete a message from a command-line search!
Access two databases at once


-------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas:
	Bring back message count estimates
	Maybe exclude tab indented paragraphs from pre-formatting
	Printable css
	In-message forward/backward for search results
	Pack the threading tree more densely somehow
	Phrase searching
	Hover over tree pops up some of the subtree
	Multi-level btree style files (faster search, slower import)
	Re-add optional lurkerd to watch mboxs

BUGS:
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
