Ideas:
	Sections for mailing lists?
	Allow control of ascending/descending sort?
	Maybe make an effort to mangle emails?
	Deleted message keyword?

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Message count estimates
	New topics
	Boolean "or" in search
	Phrase searching
	Better packing of tree
	German pot

BUGS:
	configure does not detect iconv b/c of #define on MacOS
	Need a better way to clean cache.
	Timezones suck. Need to localize times to the browser.
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
