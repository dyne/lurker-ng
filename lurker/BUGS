Ideas:
	errordocument failthrough configable
	maybe use: message/YYYYMM,email,20chars of subject,goop
		-- human recognizable

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Better packing of tree

BUGS:
	We don't check for double append
	
	Attachments are never cached because we need to tell the browser
	the content-type and we have no way to record this.
