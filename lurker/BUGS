Ideas:
	Forward / Backward message links
	errordocument failthrough configable
	maybe use: message/YYYYMM,email,20chars of subject,goop
		-- human recognizable
	secured lists? login required?
	Managle mailto: up to the worst RFC allows.
	Sort by other things than time
	Maybe manually cache first two levels of btree
	Maybe manually cache tail of the append layer

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Better packing of tree
	XSL support detection
	German pot

BUGS:
	Config reloading is broken
	We no longer support block device operation for append
	We don't check for double append
	When mmap() does not fit, speed dies - kernel cache problem
	
	Attachments are never cached because we need to tell the browser
	the content-type and we have no way to record this.
