Ideas:
	Reorder threads by reply-to?
	Gzip output?
	Link to mailing lists from complete thread view?
	More robust detection of 'From ' lines? Too many people screw it up.
		(Content-Length could help or maybe @ needed in email)
--- 1.0 boundary ---
	Printable css?
	In-message forward/backward for search results?
	Pack the threading tree more densely somehow?
	Boolean "or" in search?
	Phrase searching?
	Message count estimates for searches / indexes?
	Hover over tree pops up some of the subtree?
	Multi-level btree style files (faster search, slower import)?
	Deleted message keyword?
	Maybe make an effort to mangle email addresses?
	Re-add optional lurkerd to watch mboxs?

BUGS:
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
	Sometimes we get blank pages until reload
	Jump / search are in UTC ...
