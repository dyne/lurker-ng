Ideas:
	secured lists? login required?
	Allow control of ascending/descending sort?
	Maybe make an effort to mangle emails?

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Boolean "or" in search
	Better packing of tree
	German pot

BUGS:
	Need a better way to clean cache.
	Timezones suck. Need to localize times to the browser.
	Should symlink default.css and lang.xsl for the user.
