---- Agenda for 1.3:

Reimport restores deleted messages... (fix)
Access two databases at once
Admin interface for deleting messages?
Search by message 'id:' doesn't work due to case sensitivity

-------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas:
	In-message forward/backward for search results
	Bring back message count estimates
	Maybe exclude tab indented paragraphs from pre-formatting
	Printable css
	Pack the threading tree more densely somehow
	Phrase searching
	Hover over tree pops up some of the subtree
	Multi-level btree style files (faster search, slower import)
	Re-add optional lurkerd to watch mboxs

Set timestamp to config file + all used messages: hard
	- would need to also fix language, timestamp, etc ...
	- caching issue causes real problems since fed through xsltproc

BUGS:
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
