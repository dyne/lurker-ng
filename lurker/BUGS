Ideas:
	errordocument failthrough configable

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Date goto in mindex

	lurkerctrl
		show status of lurker
		stop/start request processing
		dump cache files
	Better packing of tree

	Hit prediction
	Thread drift indicator

	If we get an HTML only email, we don't do anything smart - just
	escape all the tags. This is ok, but it would be nice if we stripped
	them and discarded contents of <head><style>... for instance.

BUGS:
	Presently we have no keyword write buffer
	Also we don't check for double append
	
	Attachments are never cached because we need to tell the browser
	the content-type and we have no way to record this.
