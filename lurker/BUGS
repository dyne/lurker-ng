Ideas:
	errordocument failthrough configable
	Next/Prev message in list view
	maybe use: message/YYYYMM,email,20chars of subject,goop
		-- human recognizable
	secured lists? login required?
	Managle mailto: up to the worst RFC allows.
	Sort by other things than time
	Maybe manually cache first two levels of btree
	Maybe manually cache tail of the append layer

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Better packing of tree
	XSL support detection
	Forward backward links within message
	German pot

BUGS:
	Somehow or another >4k message errors are being reported by people
	False search negatives
	Config reloading is broken
	We no longer support block device operation for append
	We don't check for double append
	When mmap() does not fit, speed dies - kernel cache problem
	
	Attachments are never cached because we need to tell the browser
	the content-type and we have no way to record this.
