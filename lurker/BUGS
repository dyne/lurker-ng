Ideas:
	Timezones suck. Need to localize times to the browser?
	Allow control of ascending/descending sort?
	Maybe make an effort to mangle emails?
	Re-add optional lurkerd to match wboxs?
	Deleted message keyword?

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Compressed mboxes
	New UI
	New topics
	in-message forward/backward for search results
	Multi-level btree style files
	Message count estimates
	Boolean "or" in search
	Phrase searching
	Better packing of tree
	German pot

BUGS:
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
