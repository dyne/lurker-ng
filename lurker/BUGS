---- Agenda for 1.2:

Add "or" and "not"
	Make groups use 'or' searching internally (allows regrouping)
	delete a message? Easy if - keyword support is added

Maildir support for import

How to know when the archive starts and ends?
	Get rid of date dependency (2005 in xslt)
	Include message count estimates

---- Agenda for 2.0:

Language control from web

Access two databases at once

---- Fit in somewhere:

Set timestamp to config file + all used messages
off-site mailing list links?

-------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas:
	Maybe exclude tab indented paragraphs from pre-formatting
	Printable css
	In-message forward/backward for search results
	Pack the threading tree more densely somehow
	Phrase searching
	Hover over tree pops up some of the subtree
	Multi-level btree style files (faster search, slower import)
	Re-add optional lurkerd to watch mboxs

BUGS:
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
