Ideas:
	errordocument failthrough configable
	maybe use: message/YYYYMM,email,20chars of subject,goop
		-- human recognizable
	secured lists? login required?
	ml:debian-devel instead of ml:#
	consider mmaping the append file for faster writes
		-- would restrict us to 6Gb max email on 32bit systems
		-- would make us much faster

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Better packing of tree

BUGS:
	Writes to an open KRecord are not reflected in read cache
	We don't check for double append
	
	Attachments are never cached because we need to tell the browser
	the content-type and we have no way to record this.
