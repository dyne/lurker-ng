---- Agenda for 1.4:
	bring back the reply-to link + icon
	multiple front-ends (use mbox from summary data to hide lists)
	fix lurker-regenerate for deleted email
	somehow allow deleting messages from web
	fix case-sensitive id: searches

-------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas:
	In-message forward/backward for search results
	Bring back message count estimates
	Maybe exclude tab indented paragraphs from pre-formatting
	Printable css
	Pack the threading tree more densely somehow
	Phrase searching
	Hover over tree pops up some of the subtree
	Multi-level btree style files (faster search, slower import)

Need a way to jump to threads other than just the newest
--- perhaps include list histogram at bottom of thread page?

Set timestamp to config file + all used messages: hard
	- would need to also fix language, timestamp, etc ...
	- caching issue causes real problems since fed through xsltproc

BUGS:
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
