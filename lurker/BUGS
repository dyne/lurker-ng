Get rid of date dependency (2005 in xslt)
Fix manpages utf8 -

Message count estimates for searches / indexes

Ideas:
	Maybe exclude tab indented paragraphs from pre-formatting
	Printable css
	In-message forward/backward for search results
	Pack the threading tree more densely somehow
	Phrase searching
	Hover over tree pops up some of the subtree
	Multi-level btree style files (faster search, slower import)
	Re-add optional lurkerd to watch mboxs

BUGS:
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
