Ideas:
	Printable css?
	In-message forward/backward for search results?
	Pack the threading tree more densely somehow?
	Boolean "or" in search?
	Phrase searching?
	Message count estimates for searches / indexes?
	Hover over tree pops up some of the subtree?
	Multi-level btree style files (faster search, slower import)?
	Deleted message keyword?
	Re-add optional lurkerd to watch mboxs?

BUGS:
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
	Jump / search are in UTC ...
