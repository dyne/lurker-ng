Ideas:
	errordocument failthrough configable

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Better packing of tree

BUGS:
	We don't check for double append
	Presently we have no keyword write buffer
	
	Attachments are never cached because we need to tell the browser
	the content-type and we have no way to record this.
