Ideas:
	More robust detection of 'From ' lines? Too many people screw it up.
	Gpg keyring specification for signature checking + faces?
	Printable css?
	Maybe warn the user if the group/list search terms conflict?
	Timezones suck. Need to localize times to the browser?
	In-message forward/backward for search results?
	Pack the threading tree more densely somehow?
	Deleted message keyword?
	Maybe make an effort to mangle email addresses?
	Re-add optional lurkerd to watch mboxs?

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Multi-level btree style files
	Message count estimates
	Boolean "or" in search
	Phrase searching

BUGS:
	One can have a charset in a multipart which seems to be inheritted
	UTF-8 in attachment name... fawk.
		(http://kevb.net:3000/lurker/mbox/20030609.031031.0abceb9d.txt
	strip html? (like 0.1f)
	Some searches miss messages on intersection?

	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
