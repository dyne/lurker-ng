Ideas:
	errordocument failthrough configable
	maybe use: message/YYYYMM,email,20chars of subject,goop
		-- human recognizable
	secured lists? login required?
	ml:debian-devel instead of ml:#

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Better packing of tree

BUGS:
	Config reloading is broken
	Writes to an open KRecord are not reflected in read cache
	We no longer support block device operation for append
	We don't check for double append
	
	Attachments are never cached because we need to tell the browser
	the content-type and we have no way to record this.
