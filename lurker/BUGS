Ideas:
	Timezones suck. Need to localize times to the browser?
	In-message forward/backward for search results?
	Pack the threading tree more densely somehow?
	Deleted message keyword?
	Maybe make an effort to mangle email addresses?
	Re-add optional lurkerd to watch mboxs?

Unfulfilled requirements:
	Compressed mboxes
	A more professional UI
	New topics page
	Multi-level btree style files
	Message count estimates
	Boolean "or" in search
	Phrase searching

BUGS:
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
	No decoding of text prior to keyword scanning - BAD!
