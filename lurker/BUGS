lurker-prune loads summary data for every message between newest and oldest
present in the cache. That's WAY too much shit in RAM. The reason this
happens is because we don't know how far back in time a thread/mindex
reaches. We need to be able to answer the question of whether or not the
message's subject/successor is modified.

Ideas:
	In-message forward/backward for search results
	Bring back message count estimates
	Printable css
	Pack the threading tree more densely somehow
	Phrase searching
	Hover over tree pops up some of the subtree
	Multi-level btree style files (faster search, slower import)

Need a way to jump to threads other than just the newest
--- perhaps include list histogram at bottom of thread page?

BUGS:
	There is a slight bug in advance() pre-commit post-insert.
		(you don't always see fresh keys if partially past it)
		(... but this doesn't affect lurker, so not priority)
