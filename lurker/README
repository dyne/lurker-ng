What is lurker?
---------------

 An archiver which can handle extremely large amounts of email.
 It is fast, intuitive, and customizable.
 
 Noteworthy features;
    - Full field *fast* searching
         This allows searches like "find me all messages with foo and bar in
         the body, and beer in the subject in this date range" and much more.

    - Chronological threading
         Every other package with threaded-view breaks the arrival order of
         messages in order to display linkage. Often, they also indent quite
         deeply and eventually break when people reply back and forth enough
         times.  Lurker uses a different approach which not only preserves
         arrival order, but also does not nest so deeply that it fails when
         the replies are too deep. Plus, it's prettier. :-)

    - Message threading navigation
         Lurker has a handy navigation graphic available in each message
         which allows a user to easily see and move between messages that
         are related.

    - File attachment support
         Not only does lurker fully understand MIME, it makes file
         attachments available for download and directly embeds those a
         browser can display in the message view.

    - Multi-lingual support
         Lurker uses utf-8 and can therefore support chinese characters in
         the same page as german. Further, it is easily localized with
         translations already available for English, German, and Japanese.

    - Cache files available directly to the web server
         Instead of generating each page dynamically, lurker operates as an
         error document and creates missing pages on the fly. These pages
         are then available direct to the server for later requests. This
         scheme allows lurker to survive a slashdotting more easily since
         the pages do not need to be rerendered each time.

    - Completely customizable output
         Lurker outputs XML which is formatted via XSLT. If a site wishes to
         simply change the formatting, colours, or graphics, it need merely
         change the stylesheet (or choose an existing alternative). If the
         site needs to make actual structural changes, this is as easy as
         editing the xsl used to render the html. Further, if browsers
         support it, lurker will transmit the gzipped xml directly thus
         reducing bandwidth usage for the heftier html.
