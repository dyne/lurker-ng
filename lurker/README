lurker is a real-time mail archiver which has several aims

Non-functional requirements:
	Ability to handle up to 4 billion messages
	Fast search times: < 0.001s even at capacity
	Fast rendering: < 0.001s even at capacity
	Use the web server without cgi/mods for most pages

Target feature set:
	File attachment support
	Multilingual support
	Full boolean search with many fields
	Threading without breaking time of arrival order

Convenience goals:
	No need to use any script to input email; watch the mboxs
	No apache mods or special configuration of any sort
	Able to install in any location / permissions

Libraries used:
	We wish to keep this to a minimum, right now we use:
		libdb3
		libst
		libpopt
		libc

Portability:
	At present, only linux is supported. However, the code should be
	written so that it may later be easily ported to other architectures
	with a minimal posix feature set.
