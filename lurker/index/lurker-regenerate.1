lurker\-regenerate \(em imports messages into the archive 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBlurker\-regenerate\fR [<bin-dir>]  [<config-file>]  
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
\fBlurker\-regenerate\fR regenerates a lurker database. 
It generates a new database first, then replaces the old one with 
the new one. You will need enough diskspace for a full copy of the 
database that you want to regenerate. 
The two arguments are optional. 
.PP 
Regenerating the lurker database is the only way to recover 
disk space from deleted emails. If you delete an entire mailing 
list, you should regenerate the database. 
.PP 
Be aware of the fact that lurker-regenerate supports only databases 
from lurker >= 0.6. If you want to regenerate databases from earlier 
versions of lurker, you'll need to rm \-rf the whole database and reimport 
it manually. 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.IP "\fBbin-dir\fP" 10 
The directory containing lurker-{index,list,params,prune}. 
This defaults to where 'make install' placed them. 
.IP "\fBconfig-file\fP" 10 
The config-file for which lurker-regenerate rebuilds the  
database.
