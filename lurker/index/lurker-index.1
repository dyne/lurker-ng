.TH "LURKER-INDEX" "1" 
.SH "NAME" 
lurker-index \(em imports messages into the archive 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBlurker-index\fP [-c <config-file>]  [-l <list>]  [-v -d -f]  [-m | -b <count>]  
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
\fBlurker-index\fP indexes messages from 
standard input and stores them in the lurker database. 
It imports either a single message, or a batch of messages 
in mbox format.  
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.IP "\fB-c config-file\fP" 10 
Use this config file for lurker settings. 
.IP "\fB-l listid\fP" 10 
Import messages to the named mailing list. This should match 
the value in the lurker.conf after the 'list = ' entry. 
.IP "\fB-b count\fP" 10 
Import a batch of messages; flush every count messages. A 
good value for count is 5. In this mode lurker assumes the input 
is a mailbox delimited by 'From <addr> <date>' lines.  
Be aware that if the mbox is not delimited correctly between 
messages it will be interpretted as a single message with an 
invalid date. The larger this parameter, the more CPU power lurker 
needs during import, but the less disk seeks. 
.IP "\fB-m\fP" 10 
Import a single message. In this mode lurker will not 
interpret 'From ' lines as message delimiters. This helps for when 
lurker is being fed email directly from the MTA which sometimes 
does not escape these lines. However, if possible, make your MTA 
always escape these lines so the generated mbox is valid.  Use 
this option when fed a single message from an MTA. 
.IP "\fB-v\fP" 10 
Verbose operation. Lurker will output statistics about import 
speed to assist you in tweaking options for best throughput on 
your system. It also helps you know how much longer you will have 
to wait. 
.IP "\fB-d\fP" 10 
Drop duplicates per list. This option will check the 
database to see if the message has already been imported to a 
mailing list. Only if it has not been imported will lurker append 
it to the mailbox. Even without this option lurker does not index 
a message twice. If an import failed part-way through, you 
probably want this option to avoid needless replication. However, 
to generate mailboxes which accurately reflect delivery, leave the 
option off. 
.IP "\fB-f\fP" 10 
Fast import (but vulnerable to power-failure). This may 
improve the lifetime of your hard-disk and increase import speed 
by up to 30%. However, if the power fails during import or shortly 
thereafter, it is possible you will have a corrupted database. If 
you use a journaling filesystem, lurker guarantees no corruption 
when you OMIT this parameter.
