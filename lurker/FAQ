Q: Why shouldn't I open the lurker mboxs with a mail reader?

A: Mail readers like to modify the X-Status header by adding or removing
   flags which denote that the message is new, or opened, or read, etc.
   These changes result in displacement changes in the file even if you do
   nothing but read the file. Also, your mail reader may re-order messages
   by some criterea. Finally, you might accidentally delete a message.
   
   Solutions:
     1. Use a procmail rule to copy mail to a lurker mbox and your own mbox
        which you delete messages from:
          :0 c
          lurkers-copy.mbox
     2. Make the mailbox read only for you, but appendable by the mail
        user (or whatever user appends to the mbox):
          chown mail.youruser lurkers.mbox
          chmod 0640 lurkers.mbox


Q: Why does lurker appear to use so much RAM?

A: Well, lurker likes to mmap(). Lurker only uses 8Mb of RAM. There should
   be very little fluctuation in this. However, the VSZ will show how much
   lurker has mapped. This RAM is not in use; the kernel has not really given
   it to lurker. The RSS is how much RAM the kernel has presently given
   lurker as page cache. Again, lurker is not hoarding this RAM; there was
   just nothing else using it so the kernel buffered the last few disk
   operations for lurker. 

   Example of top on a lurker process that has run for a while:
	 PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
	1756 terpstra   9   0  229M 229M  221M S     0.0 30.3   3:43 lurkerd
   Note that 229M-221M = 8M as expected. The 221M is shared and can be
   reclaimed by any needy process.

   Examples of "ps aux" on an old and restarted lurker process:
	USER       PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ  RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
	terpstra  1756  0.0 30.3 610204 234548 ?     S    Aug18   3:43 ./lurkerd
	terpstra 28493  2.0  4.0 610204 5104 pts/2   T    21:50   0:00 ./lurkerd
   Note the VSZ (mmap'd space) is the same, but the RSS (currently held
   cache) is larger for the older process. As lurker runs, often RAM
   accumulates since most systems have more RAM than normal processes use.
   This is *ok* since the kernel is quite happy to reallocate this memory.


Q: Why not store all the messages as XML instead of rendering them as it?

A: Lurker is designed to hold lots of email. Many other programs need
   mailing list archives in mbox format. It doesn't cost much for me to
   re-parse a specific email, so there is not much speed lost. On the other
   hand, I save a lot of disk space.
   
   Example of archivers that use mbox->html + indexer:
	1Gb mbox
	2Gb html (larger on average)
	500Mb index
	---
	250% space wasted

   Example of lurker:
	1Gb mbox
	300Mb index
	---
	30% space wasted

   As you can see, since lurker builds the indexer into the *mbox* the
   index should be smaller. Also, why store the larger html/xml when it
   probably won't be necessary?
   
   Finally, even though I love XML, I think it is important to be able to
   retreive to original email without any concerns that translation back and
   forth may have slightly altered the contents of the email. Therefore, I
   consider keeping the mbox essential, and it seems natural to leave the
   data in this native format.


Q: What is better: one large mbox or lots of small ones?

A: No difference. However, recall that lurker has to open all of the mboxes,
   so if you have a lot of mailing lists, it is probably better to keep the
   archives as one large mbox so you don't run out of file descriptors.


Q: After adding a list I get "CORRUPT dataset". Why?

    lurkerd[20868]: CORRUPT dataset: Imported a message from a new mbox
    which has timestamp earlier than present. This means an mbox was
    added to the config file after the existing database had passed this
    timestamp. All timestamps in this mbox will be wrecked.

A: Well, lurker assigns internal message numbers to email it imports in
   chronological order. If you attempt to add a new list and import messages
   which are earlier than the last imported message, you will get this
   error.
   
   Solution? Stop lurker, run the "purge" (/var/lib/lurker/purge) script,
   start lurker. Wait for the import to complete.
   
   Also, creating a new list should not be a problem as long as there is no
   history for the list. If you add a new list and start importing messages
   from the current time, all is well.
   
   As to why I am not planning on fixing this: This assumption greatly
   simplifies the lurker code. Also, it makes certain operations possible
   to implement efficiently, like: searches always return most recent posts
   first, efficient keyword search + date range, etc.


Q: How can I delete a mailing list?

A: Remove the entry from the config file. Stop lurker, run the purge script,
   restart lurker. The same reasoning applies as in the preceding question.
   My goal is for lurker's import fast enough that this is not a problem.
