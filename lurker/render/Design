The render component's responsibilities include:
	rendering to an xml file the missing page
	running a default xslt transform as required for .html hits

It must support these queries:
	mindex/<list>@<offset>.html/.xml
	message/<message_id>.html/.xml
	thread/<message_id>.html/.xml
	tindex/<list>@<offset>.html/.xml
	search/<offset>@<keyword>@<keyword>@<...>@.html/.xml
