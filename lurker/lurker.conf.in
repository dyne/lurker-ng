# These are some cache settings that control how web content is cached to
# minimize CPU utilization and decrease page load times.

# This option specifies what the largest file size (in bytes) we will cache
# is. Because the purpose of the cache is to reduce CPU usage, and large
# files consume CPU cycles to serve, there is little savings in caching
# large files. They would merely be a waste of on-disk storage.

# so should have reasonably short time to live. However, pages recently
# accessed are quite likely to be hit again (imagine: slashdot). So, cache
# can pay off quite wonderfully. Index pages should not need to ever be

#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Change below this point !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# Now comes configuration for the mailing lists lurker is to host.
#
# Once lurker has indexed a mailbox, you can never take it away short of
# reimporting the database. Also, if you want to add a new list, you will
# not be able to add history without squashing all the timestamps to the
# current time.
#
# What this means: you should give all the history for all the mailing lists
# you intend to use, then start the import. If you create new mailing lists,
# no problem---just make sure that you tell lurker about them before they
# start generating mail or their timestamps may become mangled.
# 
# Finally, each mbox must be given a distinct id which is never changed or
# reused within the specified list.
# 
# You must also ensure that these mboxes are only appended to.
#
# The mboxes must never be modified in any other than append.
# This means you should NEVER OPEN THEM WITH A MAIL READER
#  --- even just to examine them; mail readers change mailboxs on OPEN.
#
# You may move the mboxes as long as you update the path given here.
#
# Here is an example:
#
# list = Debian-Devel
# 	description = Debian Developer Discussion Forum
# 	address     = debian-devel@lists.debian.org
#	
# 	mbox 20101 = /var/mail/history/archive.00020101
# 	mbox 20102 = /var/mail/history/archive.00020102
# 	mbox inbox = /var/spool/mail/debian-devel

# Include the lurker documentation
list = Lurker-Support
	description = Example mailing list configuration
