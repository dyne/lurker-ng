# The output must be encoded with a charset of UTF-8.
# The return status must be 0 exactly when the signature is correct.

# Once lurker has been configured to use a list, you must never take it

# The list 'id' should be short as it occures in urls and the database.
# The 'id' (devel in the example) will also be the name of the lurker mbox.
